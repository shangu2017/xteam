First, Kai gave the talk about the "Determination of the number of J/psi events with inclusive J/psi decays".  He answered the questions as below:


Xin: In the equation to get the N_J/psi, why the f_cor is expected to be
unity approximately?

Answer:1,limited phase space
      2,influence from detection efficiency.

Yuhang: In the part of inclusive J/ψ selection criteria, it says : "The charged tracks
are required to be detected in the MDC within a polar angle range of|cosθ| <
0.93, and to have a momentum of p < 2.0 GeV/c" .
Why is the momentum of p < 2.0 GeV/c?

Answer: Show the plot of the distribution of the Ptrk.

Shan:My question is "It is further required that the energy of the second most energetic shower is between 1.2 and 1.6 GeV and that the
 polar angles of the two showers are in the range |cosθ| < 0.8." How to get the range of 1.2-1.6 GeV ?
Answer: Show the plot of the distribution EMC.

Yuzhen:As Table 3 shown, why is the MC module uncertainty of 2012 larger
than 2009, while most of them are better than 2009?
Answer: Good Question. Not clear to me, and could not find any answer from the HyperNews
pages.	

Next, Since Xin forgot his special topic, Kai gave the ST about "selected highlights on the previous
BESIII Collaboration meeting".

At last, Shan introduced the JC95 in brief.
